Running and Testing Locally
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the server
uv run src/server.py
There is a launcher script included as launcher/client_cli.py.

To run the scenario, make sure both green and purple agents are running. Then run

python -m launcher.client_cli scenario.toml output.json
This will use the scenario file scenario.toml and will save the results in output.json

Running with Docker
# Build the image
docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t fhir-green-agent .

# Run the container
docker run --env-file .env -p 9001:9001 fhir-green-agent
Testing
Run A2A conformance tests against your agent.

# Install test dependencies
uv sync --extra test

# Start your agent (uv or docker; see above)

# Run tests against your running agent URL
uv run pytest --agent-url http://localhost:9001
Publishing
The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds, tests, and publishes a Docker image of your agent to GitHub Container Registry.

If your agent needs API keys or other secrets, add them in Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Repository secrets. They'll be available as environment variables during CI tests.

Push to main → publishes latest tag:
ghcr.io/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>:latest
Create a git tag (e.g. git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0) → publishes version tags:
ghcr.io/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>:1.0.0
ghcr.io/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>:1
Once the workflow completes, find your Docker image in the Packages section (right sidebar of your repository). Configure the package visibility in package settings.
